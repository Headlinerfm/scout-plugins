# Provide a comma-delimited list of process names (names only, no paths). This plugin checks that at least
# one instance of each named process is running, and alerts you if any of the processes have NO instances running.
# It alerts you again when one or more of the non-running processes is detected again.
#
# You can also check that a process name exists with a certain substring included in its arguments. For example, to
# check for two instances of node (one with "emailer" in its args, and one with "eventLogger" in its args), set this
# in process_names: node/emailer,node/eventLogger
#
# You can mix and match pure process_names and process_name/args. Note that the process names are always full string matches,
# and the args are always partial string matches.
